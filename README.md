#### Nightly
Nightly Flatpak builds are available from [here][nightly-build].

## Requirements
Since only the Wi-Fi LAN medium is implemented, Packet requires Bluetooth to be enabled and the devices to be connected to a Wi-Fi network with mDNS.

## Translations
If you'd like to help translate Packet to your native language, you can do so using the [Weblate][translation-platform] platform.

## FAQ

#### Can't send to app from other devices

Your firewall may be blocking Packet's port. Enable *Static Port* in Preferences and allow it through the firewall. See issue [#35](https://github.com/nozwock/packet/issues/35).

#### Downloads folder keeps resetting

In Flatpak, folder access is temporary and resets after a session restart because static access can't be requested. To set a permanent downloads folder, grant access in advance using Flatseal or run:

```sh
flatpak override --user io.github.nozwock.Packet --filesystem='/path/to/your/folder/here'
```

## Plugin Requirements
